## Description

This is a barbershop project with a unique slider and registration form.<br/>
Devellopment was implemented with pure JS (modules), also realized an adaptive design (for screens > 320px).<br/>

I notice that when I implement this project, I liked so much the realization of the slider and the registration form.


## Skills

Don't forget pure JS syntax, DOM, destructuring and interpolation, interactive form.
